The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) operates as a neutral forum where government, industry, nonprofits, and academia come together to
engage in collective problem-solving around the critical issues of the day. As the global leader in location solutions and related data,
OGC is the largest formal community of geospatial experts with a mission to make
location information FAIR – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable – for an inclusive and sustainable future.

The OGC Innovation Days Europe will foster a dialogue between technical experts, decision-makers, and policy experts, with a focus on climate & disaster resilience, one health, the role of data spaces, and the need for modernized knowledge exchange and analysis environments.
