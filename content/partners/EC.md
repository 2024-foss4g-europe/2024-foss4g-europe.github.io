The
**{{<

is honoured to join again the European open source
geospatial community gathering from 1 to 7 July at the
**{{<

conference.

Following the already well-established tradition, we are happy to renew our
partnership with the
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www.osgeo.org/"
    title="Open Source Geospatial Foundation"
    target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**
(OSGeo), centred around
the shared values of openness, transparency, reuse and reproducibility applied
to all dimensions, from data to software and standards. Concretely, this
partnership will translate into a full-day dedicated track at
FOSS4G Europe 2024, titled FOSS4G “Made in Europe”.

Open source software, including FOSS4G, is central to the European
Commission’s activities. Our

entitled
‘Think Open’, identifies open source software solutions as key building blocks
to deliver better European services, innovate society and increase security, in
addition to actively committing to support open source projects and developer
communities. The strategy builds on other important policy initiatives,
including the

and the upcoming

whereby open source software helps ensure
interoperability and technological sovereignty in key societal areas at
European scale. The recent

on the open source licensing and reuse of
Commission software complements the Open source strategy, by addressing,
among others, the Commission’s contribution to existing open source projects.

The European Commission is a strong user and supporter of open source
geospatial software. For example the majority of our web mapping building
blocks as well as underlying Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are
based on open source software. All these tools support geospatial aggregation
for pan-European data analysis in a multitude of domains, including statistical
production, environment, agriculture, transport, education, research and
smart cities.

Well-known examples include
**{{<
    extlink href="https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/"
    title="INSPIRE"
    target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**, the pan-European spatial data
infrastructure that strongly relies on open source components, and several
related policy initiatives dealing with geospatial data such as the

>}}**
and the common European Green Deal data space, whose
implementation will strongly rely on open source software. In addition, open
source technology plays an important role as technical enabler for the
interconnection of existing Earth Observations digital infrastructures, thus
feeding into EuroGEO -

increasingly used within the activities of
