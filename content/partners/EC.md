The European Commission is honoured to be part of the global community of
open source geospatial enthusiasts gathering from 1 to 7 July at the
FOSS4G Europe 2024 conference. The European Commission is contributing
to the event with a full-day dedicated track.

The European Commission is continuing the partnership with the
Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), centred around the shared values
of openness, transparency, reuse and reproducibility applied to all dimensions,
from data to software and standards.

The Commission's activities around FOSS4G are naturally flowing from its
recently renewed Open source software strategy 2020-2023 entitled
'Think Open', which identifies open source software solutions as key
building blocks to deliver better European services and enrich society,
in addition to actively committing to support open source developer communities.
This strategy builds on other important initiatives including the European
interoperability framework and the European strategy for data, whereby open
source software helps ensure interoperability and technological sovereignty in
key societal areas at the European scale. Supporting this strategy is the
recent Commission Decision 2021/C 495 I/01 on the open source licensing and
reuse of Commission software including the contribution to open source projects.

The European Commission is a strong user and supporter of open source
geospatial software. For example the majoity of the Commission web mapping
building blocks as well as underlying Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
are based on open source software. All these tools support geospatial
aggregation for pan-European data analysis in a multitude of domains,
for example statistical production, environment, agriculture, transport,
education, research and smart cities.

A well-known example is INSPIRE, the pan-European spatial data infrastructure
that strongly relies on open source components. In addition, open source
technology plays an important role as technical enabler for the establishment
of EuroGEOSS, a digital ecosystem being developed within the broader context
of Europe's contribution to the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). Geospatial
open source software, open data standards and formats are also increasingly
used within the activities of Copernicus, the European Union's Earth
observation programme, for data distribution and access.
