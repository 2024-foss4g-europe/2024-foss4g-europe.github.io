Iván has been a web developer and FLOSS advocate since the early 2000s; then he
bought a GPS receiver and got involved in OpenStreetMap and OSGeo. He’s worked
with nautical charts, indoor positioning, USB microcontrollers, LibreOffice,
multispectral rasters, all of it with unhealthy amounts of Javascript.
