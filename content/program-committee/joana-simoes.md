oana is a software engineer with more than fifteen years experience and a strong
expertise in the field of geospatial tech and analytics. After acquiring a PhD
in GIS, at UCL, her drive to solve real-world problems has led her to SMEs, an
international organisation, a research foundation and a start-up. Joana has
been very involved with FOSS, in particular in what concerns geospatial. This
has led her to become a charter member of OSGeo. Joana is the founder of
ByteRoad, a SME in the field of data engineering and geospatial analytics.
She is also a reviewer for the European Commission, and has been involved in
education, teaching the next generation of full-stack developers and data
analysts. As Developer Relations at OGC, Joana is responsible for connecting
the OGC standards with the wider developer community, hopefully increasing
their adoption and contributing towards making them more developer-friendly.
