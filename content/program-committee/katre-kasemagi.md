Currently working at IT and Development Centre at the Estonian Ministry of the
Interior (SMIT) as GIS services Product Owner. Most of our services are provided
with the help of open source GIS software. My true love for open source software
began in Bucharest FOSS4G 2019. Some of my favourite GIS tools are QGIS
and R spatial family.
