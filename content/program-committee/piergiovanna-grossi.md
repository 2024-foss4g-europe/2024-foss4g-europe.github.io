I currently work as a contract lecturer at the Department of Foreign Languages
and Literatures, University of Verona, where I conduct laboratory sessions and
courses in the field of the Digital Humanities.
My research topics are:
- Geographic Information Systems for Archaeological Research, Protection and Valorization of Cultural Heritage;
- Applied Technologies to Humanities with particular focus on Web Technologies and Digital Accessibility;
- Roman Road Network and all that is related to it (infrastructures, epigraphic documents, ancient sources).

I am a strong advocate for Free Software, Open Access, and Open Data, due to my
belief that the free circulation of knowledge is a major driving force for
progress. This is the reason I am a member of the Italian Association for Free
Geographic Information (GFOSS.it APS) and the Italian chapter of
Wikimedia Foundation, Wikimedia Italia.

Here are some of my articles and other publications at
