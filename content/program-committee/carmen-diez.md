I'm Degree in Civil Engineering and Master in Environmental Engineering and
Management of Water. Although I started in the GIS world modeling environmental
flow regime, surface water quality and hydraulic modeling flood watersheds in
Spain, actually I work in Regional Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning
in Madrid using GIS in urban planning and spatial development general management
making spatial geodatabases with urban planning information. I belong to several
groups that support the FOSS4G development as
[**Geoinquietos Madrid**](http://geoinquietos.org/grupos/madrid/),
[**GeochicasOSM**](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:GeoChicas),
AESIG and
[**Spain QGIS Association**](http://qgis.es/), and I attempt to contribute to
use free software and GIS, creation of Open Source Databases, as well as the
participation in humanitarian mapping events or local communities development.
