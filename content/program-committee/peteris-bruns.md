Free and open source GIS user, advocate and
enthusiast for 20 years. From basic use of tools turned into a wide
variety solution and service architect and integrator. Despite the
extensive and used set of tools available today, PostGIS is still the
best daily data analysis and transformation tool, and MapServer, the
first used GIS server, is still close to my heart.
