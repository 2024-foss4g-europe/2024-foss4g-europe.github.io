Luís Moreira de Sousa completed the Degree on Informatics and Computers
Engineering at the University of Lisbon in 2002, which he complemented with a
Masters on Geographic Information Systems in 2005. In the Department of Civil
Engineering of this university he was a junior researcher from 2002 to 2008,
contributing to applied research projects with Instituto da Água and Estradas
de Portugal. After a year as consultant with SIQuant at the National Laboratory
of Civil Engineering (LNEC), in 2009 he became an independent consultant,
supporting de development of the spatial data infrastructure of the newly
created Administração da Região Hidrográfica do Tejo (ARH-Tejo).

In 2011 he joined the Henri Tudor institute in Luxembourg as Research Engineer,
where he contributed to the development of Spatial Decision Support Systems on
the domains of Energy and Urban Planning. At the time he was already a PhD
candidate on Informatics Engineering at the University of Lisbon, promoted by
Prof. Alberto Silva.  In 2016 he concluded this graduation with a thesis on
domain specific languages for the development of spatial simulation programmes.
Still that year he started a post-doc position at EAWAG (Swiss Federal
Institute of Research on the Water Domain) during which he conducted research
on rapid flood modelling and storm water network management. Since 2017 Luís
has been at ISRIC - World Soil Information in The Netherlands where he conducts
research on the geography and ontology of world soils.

Luís has relied on open source software for geospatial since 2001, when he
first interacted with GRASS. Since then he contributed code and documentation
to various projects such as OWSLib, OpenLayers, QGis and others. In 2016 he
became a OSGeo charter member and integrated the first Project Steering
Committee of the PyWPS project. He was one of the founding members of the
European chapter of OSGeo and chaired the Scientific Committee of the
FOSS4G-Europe conference in 2018.  Since 2023 Luís shares the role of Chief
Returning Officer at OSGeo.
