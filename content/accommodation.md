There are many options available ranging in price levels, their location. Most bigger hotels are within a 15 minute walk from the city center and the conference venue. We will publish a more comprehensive list of choices on the conference website.

We will consult with the dormitories of the University of Tartu and the University of Life Sciences to see if we can offer cheaper-end accommodation in their facilities. To accommodate conference participants, a number of rooms with reduced prices will be reserved from among which every participant should find a suitable option. 

Participants are expected to book their accommodation individually by contacting the providers directly, using a reference code for a special price.
