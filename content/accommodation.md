There are many accommodation options available ranging in price levels & location. Majority of hotels are within a 15 minute walk from the city center and the conference venue. In addition to the hotels there is also the option of staying at a dormitory (we have agreements with 2 dorms) where the price is lower but you must consider that rooms are shared. 

Participants are expected to **book their accommodation individually** by contacting the providers directly, using a reference code for a special price. 

Here is a selection of hotels where we have made prebookings for FOSS4G. Please use the following information to book a room for yourself. If you have any questions please contact Merli from the organising team who was in contact with the accommodation partners (ilvesmerli@gmail.com).
