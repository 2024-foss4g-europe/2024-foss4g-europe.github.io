<hr>

The Academic track schedule has been relesed and can be viewed as merged
together with the [**general program schedule**](../schedule/talks/).

**NB!** the Academic track is scheduled to take place on Wednesday and Thursday
(3-4 July) in Omicum. Please see [**the venue map**](../venue/about-venue/)
for details.

Also please note, the schedule is still subject to change due to unexpected
withdrawals as well as rescheduling requests by the authors.

# Description
Following the established tradition, an Academic Track running over the days of
the FOSS4G Europe (FOSS4GE) is organised. The Academic Track is organised by
the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), in
particular
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/icwg-4-3-2/"
    title="ISPRS Intercommission Working Group IV/III/II Openness in Geospatial Science and Remote Sensing"
    target="blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**.
The [**Scientific Committee**](../scientific-committee/) of
FOSS4GE 2024 invites original research contributions addressing any topic or
domain connected to free and open source geospatial software, including (but not
limited to):
- open hardware
- open source software development
- open geospatial science
- open geospatial data
- (geo)spatial data sharing systems
- open (geospatial) cloud platforms and Services
- open (geo)education
- participatory mapping
- Digital Twins
- GeoAI and geospatial Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.

Given the European focus of the conference, authors are encouraged to develop
applications and use cases with a European scope and/or driven by European
policy initiatives and/or using datasets from prominent European initiatives
such as INSPIRE and Copernicus.

All types of papers are welcome, including results achieved, case studies,
work in progress, reviews and demos. We discourage, however, mere presentations
of technology or use cases without properly justifying originality against the
scientific state of the art and without particular novelty. In addition, the
use of open source geospatial software and its impact on the work should be
properly highlighted. Contributions from PhD students and early-stage researchers
are particularly encouraged.

In the evaluation of proposals, the [**Scientific Committee**](../scientific-committee/) will pay particular
attention to the reproducibility of the research (where this is applicable).
Reproducibility is ensured when the research makes all artefacts (input data,
computational steps, methods and code) openly available to obtain consistent
results. When available, the code shall be publicly released under an open
source license.

# How to Submit a Paper
The submission procedure is divided in two steps. Note that both steps are
mandatory in order for authors to be able to present their work at the
FOSS4GE conference.


## Step 1
**Deadline** ~~11 February~~ **25 February**

As a first step, authors are invited to submit abstracts written in English,
comprising between 800 and 1000 words and containing sufficient details for
evaluation (including the approach, results, concepts, reasons why it should be
considered and why it would be interesting for the FOSS4GE Academic Track
audience).

The submitted proposals are not publicly visible until the FOSS4G Europe 2024
[**Scientific Committee**](../scientific-committee/) has accepted them after a review period. Until then
the authors can share their proposal for feedback/proof-reading with colleagues
or friends via a link that is automatically created during submission.

The contributions are evaluated in the abstract review process. Submitted
abstracts will be refereed by the members of the [**Scientific Committee**](../scientific-committee/) for
originality/scientific novelty, relevance for the FOSS4G community,
presentation/clarity and overall quality.

As in all the fields of science, reproducibility will be considered among the
evaluation criteria (see above). Authors will receive feedback and
(for accepted abstracts) suggestions for improvement to be used for preparing
their papers, to be submitted in Step 2.

## Step 2
**Deadline 3 May**  

If the abstract is accepted, the authors are invited to submit an extended
paper that shall include original and unpublished research.

We can accept up to 2 papers per registration. If you choose this option and
the two abstracts (for which only one author is registered to the conference)
are both accepted, one proposal will be presented through a standard oral
presentation and the other one will be presented through a poster or a 5
minutes lightning talk (this will be decided at a later stage). Alternatively
(and based on the reviews) they can be both presented through posters or
lightning talks. Regardless of the situation (1 oral presentation and 1
poster/lightning talk or 2 posters/lightning talks), the authors have to write
two papers for Step 2.

Submitted papers will not be reviewed again, i.e. the acceptance of the content
is solely based on the abstract. However, papers will be checked against the
conformance to the template (see below) as well as a plagiarism check using
specialised software.

Only the work of authors who submitted the extended paper (conformant to the
template) will be included (as talks or posters/lightning talks) in the
Academic Track program. In other words, no presentation at the Academic Track
is possible without submitting the paper.

The papers will be published in
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www.isprs.org/publications/archives.aspx"
    title="The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences"
    target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**, listed in:
- ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) of the Web of Science
- SCOPUS
- E/I Compendex
- Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

As a reference, see the papers published for the
**{{<
    extlink href="https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XLVIII-4-W7-2023/"
    title="Academic Track of FOSS4G 2023"
    target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**.

Please pay attention that accepted papers will be published only after checking
that at least one author is registered to the conference, with the limit of
maximum two papers per author (as explained above). The papers will be
published online on the first day of the conference at the latest.

All papers should be formatted according to the ISPRS author’s guidelines
(template), available
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx"
    title="here"
    target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}** in both LaTeX and DOC versions.
