Did you know that Tartu will be in the spotlight in 2024 as the European Capital of Culture? The year will be packed with events showcasing the historical and cultural heritage of the second-biggest city in Estonia and the rest of South Estonia. Now is the time to visit, as even **{{< extlink href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/uk-cool-list-2024" title="National Geographic Traveller" >}}** is calling Tartu one of the 30 most exciting destinations to visit in 2024!

The general concept of the Tartu 2024 cultural program, *The Art of Survival*, is more relevant than ever before. This idea centers around three aspects related to the influence of art on the future of Europe â€” an environmentally friendly culture with an emphasis on real human interactions, strong communities, and survival skills. There is a varied program of over 300 events throughout the year.
