#### Blue and Green cover around Tartu

Poster by: Prajwal Parmar, CEPT University

The map is created by using the overlay effect in QGIS. NDWI, NDVI and Urban False color composite were retrieved from Sentinel Hub (EO Browser). The base layer is the urban false color composite and the other two layers are on top of the base layer but using the overlay effect in the symbology I have tried to enhance the water bodies and green cover.

#### Building heights in Tartu

Poster by: Raúl García Estévez, University of Tartu

The following map is a 3D visualization of the urban landscape in Tartu, Estonia. The main dataset employed is the buildings from Estonian Land Board (Maa-amet). As background information roads (Maa-amet) and city districts (Tartu City Government) were used. The map was created in QGIS, combining 2.5D symbols and height classification using the height attribute from the original dataset to create a realistic representation of the urban environment.
