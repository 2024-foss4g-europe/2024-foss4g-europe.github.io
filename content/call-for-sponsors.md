The Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Europe conference is the main
OSGeo regional European community meetup. It is a weeklong event featuring two
days of workshops, three days of spoken word presentations, and two days for
community sprint to sum up the week.

FOSS4GE 2024 will be an in-person event but we are working hard to make
streaming of all presentations a reality in addition to recorded material which
will later be published on the OSGeo YouTube channel and TIB-AV portal.

We are honoured to invite you to take this opportunity to be a financial partner

### Partnership packages

We are preparing two types of preconfigured sponsorship packages. One is the
traditional platinum, gold, silver, bronze and supporter tiers. The other
with a more specific goal of helping us cover certain costs: like live-streaming,
coffee breaks, lunch breaks, ice-breaker, etc. Both types are equatable with
each other depending on the amount of sponsorship: offerings in both types are
the same but the latter has a little extra directly related with the type
of support you are extending to the conference.

Specific sponsorship packages will be published on this page and announced
on the FOSS4GE social media accounts very soon. Stay tuned.
