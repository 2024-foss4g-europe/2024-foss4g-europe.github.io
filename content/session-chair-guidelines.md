The FOSS4G conferences are easy-going and welcoming environments.
As a session chair, you have the power to create and sustain this attitude.
Taking the stage before tens and tens of people might be a real challenge for
some of us. Let's try to make it an enjoyable and comfortable experience for
all of us - the speakers and the audience.

- Try to make beforehand contact with speakers in the session you are chairing.
Maybe they have some ideas about how they want to be introduced. This is especially
useful if you don't know them personally. Chairing a session is a super way of
getting to know new people.
- Be there at least 10 minutes before the session begins. That will leave time
to sort out any problems that may arise.
- There will be volunteers in the session rooms. They are there to assist you
and can help you with any technical questions.
- Slides for the talks in the session will be downloaded to the venue room
computer by a volunteer from the pretalx schedule at
**{{<

>}}**. Make sure all the presentations are there before the session starts. If
there are any issues please consult the volunteer in the room.
- Your task is to introduce the speaker and the talk. In which way you do it is
entirely up to you.
- Also guiding the QA session after the presentation. If and how many questions
a speaker can have depends on the amount of time available. Although the event
is streamed, questions will be taken only from the on-site crowd. Please keep
in mind that because of streaming/recording all spoken word needs to go into
the microphone even if the venue room is small and it seems pointless.
- Please stick to the schedule! This is super important for 2 reasons - we have
five parallel sessions running in different rooms at all times, and there's also
a live stream audience we need to think about.
  - Talks should start on time (and not before) because there are people coming
  from other sessions, and a live stream audience who are following the schedule.
  - Talks should end on time (and not later) so the session audience will
  have at least five minutes to change to another session/room if they want to.
- You are responsible for timing the talks. The rooms will be equipped with
"5 min" and "1 min" signs you can use to signal the speaker for the time that
is left. So:
  - a regular talk is 20 minutes of presentation time, 5 minutes QA, and 5 minutes
for changing rooms/speakers.
  - a lightning talk is 4 minutes presentation time, 1 minute changing
rooms/speakers. No QA time during the slot.
- What if the speaker does not turn up? You can choose how you fill the
unexpected break. Please do not, under any circumstances, take the next talk
in the schedule, there are people in other sessions who have planned to come
for the talk, too! And please notify the conference program committee about
the no-show speaker/presentation.

And that should be pretty much it. If you have any further questions please
feel free to get back to
