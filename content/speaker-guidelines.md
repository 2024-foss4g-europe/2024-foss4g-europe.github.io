The FOSS4G Europe 2024 conference is coming closer day by day, and
we're happy to report all preparations are well underway and we are gearing
up for a very exciting event. Let's go over a few points to keep in
mind when preparing for your presentation.

- Your presentation will be streamed and recorded taking into account
the boxes you have ticked for your proposal at
**{{<

    title="talks.osgeo.org"
    target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**. If you answered no to streaming, the video crew has some fantastic
local wild nature scenes we will be using as a replacement during that time.
- There will be volunteers in the session rooms. They can help you with any
technical questions that might arise.
- Your session will be chaired by someone, who will introduce you and your talk,
and guide the QA. Although the event is streamed, questions will be taken
only from the on-site crowd. Please keep in mind that because of
streaming/recording all spoken word needs to go into the microphone even if
the venue room is small and it seems pointless.
- Session chairs will be announced in the days leading up to the conference. If
you haven't met them before, it's a super opportunity to get to know new
people.
- Please stick to the schedule. This is important for 2 reasons - we have five
parallel sessions running in different rooms at all times, and there's also a
live stream audience we need to think about. Your session chair will help you
with timing and will signal you if you need to wrap up quickly. So:
  - a regular talk is 20 minutes of presentation time, 5 minutes QA, and 5 minutes
for changing rooms/speakers.
  - a lightning talk is 4 minutes presentation time, 1 minute changing
rooms/speakers.
- If you have your slides prepared you can upload them as an attachment
to your talk proposal at the general program
**{{<

>}}**.
You can add both, files or URLs to presentations (e.g gh-pages hosted webpages).
Please try to keep uploaded files less than 10MB in size. You can upload your
presentation at any time up to 30 minutes before your session starts. But please
even if you really like living on the edge try not to leave it to the last
minute. Things piling up somewhere there will not help the conference experience
for any of us.
- NB! Academic track presenters! Please use the general program submissions page
also for Academic Track presentations. Let's collect presentations all under
the same pretalx event so they are easily accessible from the unified schedule.
- Internet connectivity is there, but donâ€™t rely solely on it.
Oddly, things tend to break exactly at the moment of live demos.
- Using your own laptop is strongly discouraged as it makes
everybody's lives much simpler if you present your prepared slides from
the venue computer - we'll have less hassles with setup and no hiccups with
streaming.

And that should be pretty much it. If you have any further questions please
feel free to get back to
