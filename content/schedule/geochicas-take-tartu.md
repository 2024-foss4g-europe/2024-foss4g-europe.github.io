GeoChicas are an international women’s mapping community with members in more
than 12 different countries. Our aim is for women to have a greater presence and
participation in key OSM events, increase female participation and leadership,
and work on mapping projects which benefit women. Our main focus as a group is
to help close the gender gap in the OSM community across participation, data
creation and curation.

Everyone is welcome to join the GeoChicas Take Tartu event on 2 July after the
B2B meeting. The event starts at 20:00 in a closeby venue called
**{{<

>}}**, a culture club known as the place of mainstream, side-stream, direct, and
alternating current parties, concerts, movie evenings, quizes, exhibitions, and
lectures for all, regardless of age or other peculiarities.

GeoChicas Take Tartu is an event where to meet other women and allies attending
FOSS4GE 2024 who are interested in closing the gender gap and working towards
diversity in our communities. **First hour 20:00 - 21:00 is only for women and people
identifying as women but afterwards everyone is welcome!** After 21:00 everyone is welcome to join!

We’ll try to break the ice and get off to a great start at FOSS4G Europe 2024
while having fun and doing karaoke! First drink is on us! If you wish to take part in the event we kindly also ask you to register to the event. **The event is completely free but this way we can plan the activities and food better!**
