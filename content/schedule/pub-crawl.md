There are many great cafes/pubs/bars around in Tartu. The LOC has selected
a few that we like that capture the studentesque atmosphere of the town. We're
also doing this listing in the hopes that it will give you more opportunities
to meet the fellow conference-goers for late night (and early morning!) discussions
on specific topics related to free and open source in geospatial. Maybe meet
up with the presenter from the daily sessions to discuss the specifics of their
presentation. Or meet up with the developers or other users of your most
favourite piece of software, someone you maybe only know by their @-handle or
email-address.

Most of the nightlife is concentrated along Rüütli tn - a car free street in the
city center with lots of opportunities for outside seating during the summer.
But there are cosy and welcoming places beyond the immediate center too.

## Mülä
<div class="double-container">
<img class="logo" src="../../images/map-icons/myla.png">
Address: Kroonuaia 76<br><br>
Located at the very border of the city center and
<b>{{<
  extlink href="https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supilinn"
  title="Supilinn"
  target="blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">}}</b> (Estonian for <i>Soup Town</i>),
Mülä is a community bar whose soul lives on the shore of river Emajõgi in a
red-brick house. A cafe during daytime with delicious cakes and buns made on
the spot, turned bar in the evenings.

Oh and by the way, although the address says Kroonuaia tn, the entrance is
from Emajõe tn.

## Möku
<div class="double-container">
<img class="logo" src="../../images/map-icons/moku.png">
Address: Magasini 5<br><br>
Housed in the <i>sub-culture house</i>
<b>{{<
  extlink href="https://genklubi.ee/"
  title="Genialistide klubi"
  target="blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">}}</b>
(or Genklubi for short) on Magasini tn tucked away from the riff-raff of the
city center. But still in the center.

Also features a fantasy
<b>{{<
  extlink href="https://mapstodon.space/@mappery"
  title="#MapsInTheWild"
  target="blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">}}</b> moment. Let's see if you can spot it...
</div>

## Pühaste Kelder
<div class="double-container">
<img class="logo" src="../../images/map-icons/pyhaste.png">
Address: Rüütli 11<br><br>
Pühaste Kelder, located in the heart of Tartu, is the representative bar of
Pühaste Brewery. Here, the freshest IPAs are less than 24 hours old.
</div>

## Vein ja Vine
<div class="double-container">
<img class="logo" src="../../images/map-icons/veinjavine.png">
Address: Rüütli 8<br><br>
Vein and Vine is a cozy wine bar where great people meet alongside with an
even better glass of wine.
</div>


## Illegaard
<div class="double-container">
<img class="logo" src="../../images/map-icons/illegaard.png"/>
Address: Ülikooli 5<br><br>
Also known as Illekas. In all probability one of the oldest still functioning
bars in Tartu dating back to times when some of the LOCers were still in
middle-school. And some where not born yet.

## Barlova
<div class="double-container">
<img class="logo" src="../../images/map-icons/barlova.jpg">
Address: Tähe 29<br><br>
Perfectly representing the spirit of Tartu's artsy
<b>{{<
  extlink href="https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlova"
  title="Karlova"
  target="blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer">}}</b> neighbourhood
(Bar + Karlova = Barlova, get it?), this relaxed, little haunt is a vibrant
cultural place, populated by a great mixture of expats and locals, youngsters
and grownups. The Italian owner has become somewhat of a local celeb and is
probably the reason this place serves the best coffee in town. Barlova is
equally good for a quick pint or a game of Scrabble with friends.
