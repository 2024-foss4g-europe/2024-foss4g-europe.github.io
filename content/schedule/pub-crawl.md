There are many great cafes/pubs/bars around and in Tartu. The LOC has selected
a few that we like that capture the studentesque atmosphere of the town. We're
also doing this listing in the hopes that it will give you more opportunities
to meet fellow conference-goers for late-night (and early morning!) discussions
on specific topics related to free and open source in geospatial. Maybe meet
up with the presenter from the daily sessions to discuss the specifics of their
presentation. Or meet up with the developers or other users of your
favourite piece of software, someone you maybe only know by their @-handle or
email address.

Most of the nightlife is concentrated along Rüütli tn - a car-free street in the
city centre with lots of opportunities for outside seating during the summer.
But there are cosy and welcoming places beyond the immediate centre too.

During the conference week, our partner pubs will be also marked with special
FOSS4GE 2024 signs so it's easier to find them on the streets. Feel free to
step in and try to ask for a custom FOSS4GE conference drink.

Located at the very border of the city centre and

  rel="noopener noreferrer">}}</b> (Estonian for <i>Soup Town</i>),
Mülä is a community bar whose soul lives on the shore of river Emajõgi in a
red-brick house. A cafe during the daytime with delicious cakes and buns made on
the spot, turned bar in the evenings.

Oh, and by the way, although the address says Kroonuaia tn, the entrance is
from Emajõe tn.

Also known as Illekas. In all probability one of the oldest still-functioning
bars in Tartu dating back to times when some of the LOCers were still in
middle-school. And some were not born yet.
