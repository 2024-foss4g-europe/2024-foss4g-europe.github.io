**Saturday and Sunday, 6-7 July 2024**

FOSS4G Europe 2024 is happy to host the OSGeo community sprint.

Participation is free of charge and anyone involved or interested in getting
involved in OSGeo community projects is welcome. **Lunch will be provided to the people taking part in the event!**

You can choose to contribute to one or more projects. The sky is the limit.
There’s always plenty to do - and it’s not all about programming. Translation,
documentation, feedback, discussions, and testing are very important for

the community sprint.

as it helps us with better planning for food and other resources.
