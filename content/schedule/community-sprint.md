**Saturday and Sunday, 6-7 July 2024**

FOSS4G Europe 2024 is happy to host the OSGeo community sprint.

Participation is free of charge and anyone involved or interested in getting
involved in OSGeo community projects is welcome.

You can choose to contribute to one or more projects. The sky is the limit.
There’s always plenty to do - and it’s not all about programming. Translation,
documentation, feedback, discussions, and testing are very important for
projects! Conference registration is not a prerequisite for participation in
the community sprint.

Although participation in the sprint is free of charge we kindly ask you to

as it helps us with better planning for food and other resources.
