Tartu, Estonia

View the [preliminary agenda below](#agenda).

**Registration opening soon.**

**Co-organized with [FOSS4G Europe: 1-7 July,
2024](https://2024.europe.foss4g.org/).**

The European IT landscape is changing rapidly. Several initiatives are
underway, such as developing Data Spaces and Digital Twins, supporting
the Green Deal, or otherwise trying to integrate the largely
heterogeneous IT landscape. What do these mean for the leading
challenges of our century? How can these predominantly technologically
oriented efforts help with climate change and disaster resilience? Do
they support Land Degradation Neutrality?

The OGC Innovation Days Europe connects the technological aspects with
the equally important aspects of governance and policy and thus fills a
critical gap: **The event provides a platform to discuss how the current
technical efforts can be combined with the necessary governance and
policy aspects.** What decision processes do we need? What agreements
are required for efficient decision processes or homogeneous reporting
models, for example, for climate change or Land Degradation Neutrality? 

OGC Innovation Days Europe addresses the requirements of multiple
stakeholders and policymakers for digital solutions that meet various
needs efficiently and in a user-friendly way. OGC co-organizes the
Innovation Days with the

>}}**
and [**FOSS4G Europe 2024**](https://2024.europe.foss4g.org/).
The event brings the internationally leading
software development and data management experts together with
non-technical experts to exchange information and learn from each other.
The Stakeholders' needs will be discussed and understood in depth while
newly developed prototypes will be presented and trained.

##### Thematic focus: Climate and Disaster Resilience, One Health, and Global Stocktake

Achieving climate and disaster resilience and sustainability requires
reliable location information on the environment, land, and climate.
Generating this information dedicated to the users' needs is
challenging. It needs highly optimized spatial data infrastructures and
climate resilience information systems operated within a targeted policy
framework and driven by an efficient policy model. Interoperable data
pipelines and well-organized data spaces with their data assessment
applications, combined with analysis, visualization, and reporting
tools, are required to gain the knowledge to enroll climate strategies
and actions.

With the thematic focus on land and climate, the OGC European Innovation
Days will foster dialogue between technical experts, decision-makers,
and policy experts. Particular emphasis is on public health, land
degradation neutrality, global stocktake, the role of data spaces, and
the need for modernized data exchange and analysis environments: 

-   The public increasingly requires a collaborative, multi-sectoral,
    and transdisciplinary local-to-global perspective. The
    **{{<
        extlink href="https://climate-health.eu"
        title="EU climate-health cluster"
        target="blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >}}**
    actively engages in promoting dialogue on
    diverse climate-induced health issues, encompassing challenges such
    as the transmission of zoonotic and vector-borne pathogens, coastal
    water pathogens, heat-related impacts, and pollution. Its objective
    is to formulate impactful mitigation and adaptation strategies
    through innovative research. Emphasis is placed on heightening
    awareness, facilitating the dissemination of research findings, and
    supporting evidence-based decision-making. The cluster aims to build
    capacity, foster resilience, and collaborate with stakeholders to
    provide scientific evidence and policy advice for stronger EU and
    global policies.
-   The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will
    emphasize geospatial reporting Indicators, especially the
    Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3.1 Land Degradation
    Neutrality.
-   The Global Stocktake is in focus for the European Centre for
    Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the European Space Agency
    (ESA). 
-   The value of National Spatial Infrastructures is the focus of the
    **{{<

        title="Location Innovation Hub"
        target="blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >}}**.
    The hub will introduce the role of
    modernized SDIs and the requirements for future systems. 

##### Expected Outcomes of OGC Innovation Days Europe

The workshop will compile the findings of the set of sessions. It will
refine the identified requirements for the dataspaces to enhance the
information and knowledge exchange on scientific, technical, and policy
levels. 

The OGC Innovation Days results will help make future systems more
efficient. The event contributes to shifting the focus from a
technology-oriented approach to a holistic approach. This approach takes
a much better account of the various needs of the stakeholders involved.
Focusing on the needs of the different stakeholders is crucial to the
success of the current work. This event will identify these needs and
thus make an essential contribution to improving the direction of future
technological developments, operational setups driven by efficient
governance models, and all operating within a solution-oriented policy
framework.
