**Co-organized with [FOSS4G Europe: 1-7 July,
2024](https://2024.europe.foss4g.org/).**

OGC Innovation Days Europe seeks to address stakeholders’ and policymakers’ need for digital solutions that can meet their requirements efficiently and in a user-friendly way. To this end, the event will bring internationally leading software development and data management experts together with non-technical experts – such as urban planners, policy makers, economists, and other beneficiaries of geospatial information – to exchange information and learn from each other. The stakeholders’ needs will be discussed and understood in depth while newly developed prototypes will be presented.

OGC is co-organizing Innovation Days Europe with the

and [**FOSS4G Europe 2024**](https://2024.europe.foss4g.org/).

**OGC Innovation Days Europe provides a platform to discuss how current technical efforts can be combined effectively with the necessary governance and policy aspects.** What decision processes do we need? What agreements are required for efficient decision processes or homogeneous reporting models for, for example, Climate Change or Land Degradation Neutrality?

##### Thematic focus: Climate and Disaster Resilience, One Health, and Global Stocktake

Achieving climate and disaster resilience and sustainability requires reliable location information on the environment, land, and climate. Generating this information dedicated to the users’ needs is challenging. It needs highly optimized spatial data infrastructures and climate resilience information systems operated within a targeted policy framework and driven by an efficient policy model. Interoperable data pipelines and well-organized data spaces with their data assessment applications, combined with analysis, visualization, and reporting tools, are required to gain the knowledge to enroll climate strategies and actions.

OGC Innovation Days Europe will foster a dialogue between technical experts, decision-makers, and policy experts, with a focus on climate & disaster resilience, one health, the role of data spaces, and the need for modernized knowledge exchange and analysis environments:

-   The public increasingly requires a collaborative, multi-sectoral,
    and transdisciplinary local-to-global perspective. The
    **{{<
        extlink href="https://climate-health.eu"
        title="EU climate-health cluster"
        target="blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >}}**
    actively engages in promoting dialogue on
    diverse climate-induced health issues, encompassing challenges such
    as the transmission of zoonotic and vector-borne pathogens, coastal
    water pathogens, heat-related impacts, and pollution. Its objective
    is to formulate impactful mitigation and adaptation strategies
    through innovative research. Emphasis is placed on heightening
    awareness, facilitating the dissemination of research findings, and
    supporting evidence-based decision-making. The cluster aims to build
    capacity, foster resilience, and collaborate with stakeholders to
    provide scientific evidence and policy advice for stronger EU and
    global policies.
-   The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will
    emphasize geospatial reporting Indicators, especially the
    Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3.1 Land Degradation
    Neutrality.
-   The Global Stocktake is in focus for the European Centre for
    Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the European Space Agency
    (ESA). 
-   The value of National Spatial Infrastructures is the focus of the
    **{{<

        title="Location Innovation Hub"
        target="blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >}}**.
    The hub will introduce the role of
    modernized SDIs and the requirements for future systems. 

##### Expected Outcomes of OGC Innovation Days Europe

The workshop will compile the findings of the set of sessions. It will
refine the identified requirements for the dataspaces to enhance the
information and knowledge exchange on scientific, technical, and policy
levels. 

OGC Innovation Days Europe supports the shift in IT solutions from being purely technology-oriented to a more holistic approach that better accounts for the various needs of the stakeholders. The event will identify these needs and thus make an essential contribution to improving the direction of future technological developments, supporting operational setups that are driven by efficient governance models and that operate within a solution-oriented policy framework.
