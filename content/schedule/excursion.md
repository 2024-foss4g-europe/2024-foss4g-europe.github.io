### Short description of the excursion


In Setomaa you will see different natural and cultural sites during our bus trip:

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Lüübnitsa is a Russian village in northern Setomaa on the coast of Lake Pskov. The local inhabitants are involved in the cultivation of onions and fishing. We will visit the **{{< extlink href="https://www.visitestonia.com/en/luubnitsa-viewing-tower" title="Lüübnitsa viewing tower" >}}** on the beach, which provides one with a good view of the village, Kolpino Island and the Estonian-Russian border.  | {{< figure

    caption="Source: [**visitsetomaa.ee**](https://visitsetomaa.ee/en/attractions/97/mikitam%C3%A4e-orthodox-village-chapels)"
>}}    | Tsässon is an **{{< extlink href="https://visitsetomaa.ee/en/attractions/97/mikitam%C3%A4e-orthodox-village-chapels" title="Orthodox village chapel" >}}** in Setumaa. The square in front of Mikitamäe Center is called Tsässonate Square, because there are two tsässons next to each other. Old tsässon is the oldest wooden building in mainland Estonia: its probable construction date is 1694. |
| In 2020, a lovely promenade with two viewing platforms was built along the coast of Värska Bay. The different sections of the **{{< extlink href="https://maps.visitsetomaa.ee/en/objects/vaerska-promenade/157?map_id=7" title="300-meter promenade" >}}** are united by the use timber and granite, the two main construction materials. The springs have been directed into beautiful natural waterways.  |{{< figure

>}}  | [**Saatse 'Boot'**](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/saatse-boot) is a boot-shaped area of the Russian state border that cuts the Värska–Saatse road for 800 m. Every traveller on the road briefly enters the territory of the Russian Federation. A Russian visa is not required to pass the boot, but you must have your passport or identity document with you. This is a border area that can be crossed without stopping by car or bicycle.           |
| We will visit the **{{< extlink href="https://www.visitestonia.com/en/piusa-caves-visitor-centre" title="observation platform at the Museum Cave" >}}**. The Piusa sandstone caves are the result of hand-mining glass sand during 1922–1966. The biggest wintering colony of bats in East Europe is located in the caves. There are also nice views to the open sand quarry. | {{< figure
