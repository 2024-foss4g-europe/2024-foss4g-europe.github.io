Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are unstructured timeslots where people can
self-organise themselves to discuss topics of interest. So if there's any
specific topics you'd like to discuss face to face with other people this is
exactly the chance.

BoF's can be held in BoF rooms at specified timeslots or taken off-site for
breakfast, lunch, or dinner!

The FOSS4G Europe conference provides the BoF rooms, but the setup of the
bird-of-feather meetup is done informally using

by you yourself.

We will try to keep up and add the ones taking place during the allocated time
slots also to

to give a better overview of the discussions that are taking place.
