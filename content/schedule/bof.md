**Wednesday (3 July), Thursday (4 July)**  
**18:00 - 19:00**  
Venue: Vanemuise 46 building

Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are unstructured timeslots where people can
self-organise themselves to discuss topics of interest. So, if there are any
specific topics you'd like to discuss face-to-face with other people this is
exactly the chance.

BoF's can be held in BoF rooms at specified timeslots or taken off-site for
breakfast, lunch, or dinner!

The FOSS4G Europe conference provides the BoF rooms, but the setup of the
bird-of-feather meetup is done informally using

by you yourself.

We will try to keep up and add the ones taking place during the allocated time
slots also to

to give a better overview of the discussions that are taking place.
