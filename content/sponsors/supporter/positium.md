Positium is a data analytics spin-off company from University of Tartu, Estonia.<br><br>
We are leading experts in developing methodologies for producing official
statistics from mobile positioning data (MPD). Founded in 2003, we have over a
decade of experience working with global clients and scientists.<br><br>
We strive to improve the quality of life for people around the world through
data-driven decisions by providing methods and solutions for extracting
trustworthy knowledge from MPD.<br><br>
Timely and accurate data is essential for making sound decisions in today's
fast-paced world. The United Nations recognizes MPD as a powerful big data
source. It allows for the accurate and timely measurement of population
locations and movements. This data can be effectively used to depict reality
and extract valuable insights across a wide range of domains that can benefit
greatly from this information.<br><br>
For processing these large datasets of location data we use a variety of open
source tools. We are very glad that FOSS4G Europe 2024 is happening in our
beloved city of Tartu and is bring together a diverse group of geospatial
professionals to share and promote the use of free and open source software
in the geospatial field.
