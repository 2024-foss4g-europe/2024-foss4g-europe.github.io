Septima supports innovation and collaboration, embodying the spirit of open
source and open data. Founded with the release of the public basic data in
Denmark, Septimas mission has been to maximize the utility of open data for
businesses, public authorities, and private organizations alike. Our expertise
spans the analysis, enrichment, and visualization of  geodata.

At Septima we focus on developing geospatial systems, services, and products.
Our commitment to the open-source community include active involvement in
projects such as FlatGeoBuf, and contributions to a number of other projects.
We recognize that code is not everything, and also contribute actively to the
more tedious work around developing the local QGIS community - and actively
work on securing funding for core work and bugfixing on the projects we use.

Our involvement in QGIS and the surrounding communities is recognized both
domestically and globally. We offer training and certified courses but also
provide support, consulting, and development of plugins and core code
enhancements, focusing on a robust open-source GIS ecosystem.
