provides digital maps, which you can customize and integrate into
websites and mobile apps. We provide a maps API for developers, map tiling
software to turn imagery & vector geodata into map tiles, and a map server for
self-hosting, an on-premise solution for serving map tiles from MBTiles,
GeoPackage, and PostGIS. At MapTiler, we â™¡ open source and believe in its
importance to geographical systems.

- In 2017, we started OpenMapTiles - the first truly open project for
generating vector tiles, and we are still maintaining it now. The wider
community is very active, with dozens of commits each month.
- We developed and maintain an open source QGIS plugin for the easy loading of
vector maps and were one of the sponsors of vector tiles in QGIS. We have
continued this effort, collaborating on the support of RGB terrain data in
QGIS via the web.
- MapTiler is also one of the founding members of the MapLibre community and
a significant contributor.

We support open source projects with our free tier maps via API. Use them in
web & mobile apps and desktop GIS software. If the free tier is insufficient
for your project, please contact us, as we may be willing to support it with
a higher plan for free.
