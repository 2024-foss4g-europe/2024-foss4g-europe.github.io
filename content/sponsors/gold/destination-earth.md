What does Destination Earth do?
<br><br>
Destination Earth (DestinE) is an ambitious initiative of the European Union
to create a highly accurate digital model of Earth. It utilises an unprecedented
amount of data, innovative Earth system models, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
cloud computing, high-speed connectivity networks and data from multiple
existing and new sources. Europe's cutting-edge computing is utilized to
monitor the effects of natural and human activity on our planet, enable users
to anticipate extreme events and test and adapt policies addressing
climate-related challenges.
<br><br>
The components that are at the core of DestinE are:
1. DestinE Platform operated by ESA, providing decision-making tools,
applications and services, based on an open, flexible, and secure
cloud-based computing system;
2. **{{<

DestinE will support tackling complex environmental challenges to:
- monitor and simulate the Earth’s system developments (land, marine,
  atmosphere, biosphere) and human interventions;
- anticipate environmental disasters and resultant socio-economic crises
  to save lives and avoid large economic downturns;
- enable the development and testing of scenarios for ever more sustainable
  development.

Destination Earth is thrilled to participate at FOSS4GE Europe 2024 and
showcase the opportunities it will offer to the geospatial community and
beyond! Discover more about DestinE initiative at FOSS4G Europe 2024!
