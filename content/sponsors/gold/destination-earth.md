Destination Earth (DestinE) is an ambitious initiative of the European Union to
create a highly accurate digital model of Earth. It utilises an unprecedented
amount of data, innovative Earth system models, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
cloud computing, high-speed connectivity networks and data from multiple
existing and new sources. Europe's cutting-edge computing is utilized to
monitor the effects of natural and human activity on our planet, enable users
to anticipate extreme events and test and adapt policies addressing
climate-related challenges.

DestinE Components:

adaptation which combines data from real-time observations and simulations.

DestinE will support tackling complex environmental challenges to:
- monitor and simulate the Earth’s system developments (land, marine,
  atmosphere, biosphere) and human interventions;
- anticipate environmental disasters and resultant socio-economic crises to
  save lives and avoid large economic downturns;
- enable the development and testing of scenarios for ever more
  sustainable development.
