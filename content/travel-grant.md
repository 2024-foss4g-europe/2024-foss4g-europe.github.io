##### FOSS4GE 2024 Travel Grant Programme (TGP)

OSGeo provides a Travel Grant Program (TGP) to facilitate accessibility and diversity at the FOSS4GE 2024 Conference, which will happen in Tartu, Estonia, 1 - 7 July 2024.

The TGP is administered by the Conference Committee (CC) and supported by members of the LOC. Applications will be accepted until 15 March 2024.

#####  Travel Grants

The Travel Grant will include a full conference ticket (including 2 workshop tracks) and a lump-sum contribution towards travel, accommodation or other expenses.

The size of the travel grant will be 400 to 500â‚¬, depending on the number of applicants. 

#####  Criteria

In order to guarantee a transparent and fair allocation of funds, the travel grant programme uses a points system for ranking applications. Points are awarded if applicants match specific criteria. After the application phase is over, all applicants are ranked by points, and the applicants with the most points will receive funding.

Please note that the purpose of the travel grant programme is to enhance diversity at the conference. We might reserve a few programme spots for people with unique and outstanding applications. However, the majority of programme spots will solely be determined by the point ranking.

Applicants receive points for the following criteria:

#####  Payment

You must be able to fund the direct costs of your travel to FOSS4G and be in possession of a valid entry visa and immunization documents (if required). Successful applicants will receive a conference pass and become eligible for reimbursement of expenses up to the limit of the travel grant when they check-in at the conference registration desk. Reimbursement of expenses will be by electronic means (details to be advised).

Only in the case of demonstrated needs and exceptional cases, the travel grant amount will be provided in advance or used to cover specific travel costs directly.

#####  Supporting the TGP
The travel grant program is funded through:

- Conference sponsors
- Sponsor donations, recognized as part of OSGeo sponsorship program
- Annual commitment from the OSGeo board

You can help to make FOSS4G more accessible and increase the diversity of our attendees by making a donation to the FOSS4G TGP through the PayPal account of the OSGeo local chapter that is managing the conference.
