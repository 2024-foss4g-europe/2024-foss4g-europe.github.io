### Transport to Tartu

---

#### Water
Although Tartu is located on the shores of river Emajõgi, it is not possible to
travel here by boat alone. If you still fancy a seafaring trip, the easiest
option would be to take a ferry to Tallinn, and then continue by bus or train.

##### 1. From Stockholm
This is an overnight trip (~17h) and usually runs once a day by varrier.
Possible carriers include (but are not limited to):
- **{{< extlink href="https://en.tallink.com/stockholm-tallinn-one-way-trip" title="Tallink" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}**
- **{{< extlink href="https://www.sales.vikingline.com/find-trip/timetable/stockholm-tallinn/" title="Viking Line" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}**

##### 2. From Helsinki
The trips between Helsinki and Tallinn are frequent and take roughly 2.5-3h
with some of the carriers offering the possibility to stay on board overnight
for the last trip of the day. Possible carriers include (but are not limited to):
- **{{< extlink href="https://en.tallink.com/helsinki-tallinn-one-way-trips" title="Tallink" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}**
- **{{< extlink href="https://www.sales.vikingline.com/find-trip/timetable/helsinki-tallinn/" title="Viking Line" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}**
- **{{< extlink href="https://www.eckeroline.com/journeys/journeys-departing-from-helsinki/reittimatka-route" title="Eckerö Line" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}**

#### Bus

##### 1. From Tallinn

hours, otherwise every hour during daytime) with a total trip time of about
2.5h. Most (but not all!) buses departing

**{{< extlink href="https://www.tpilet.ee/en/" title="TPilet" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}** website.

specific trip) - there might not always be a place when buying the ticket on
the bus.

##### 2. From Riga
The bus option is also scarce but faster (5h) than the train: currently, there are
2 direct connections available via
**{{< extlink href="https://luxexpress.eu/en/?fromBusStopId=18859&toBusStopId=17058&passengers=1&currency=EUR" title="Lux Express" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}**.

#### Bicycle / hiking / motorcycle / car
The road is an adventure - you make your own schedule.

A few things to remember if you are planning a motorized trip:
- there are no motorways in Estonia, only a few of the main highways have dual
carriageways in parts.
- Estonia has right-hand traffic and an extensive road system, the quality of
which varies
- the speed limit on the highways is 90 km/h and 50 km/h in urban areas unless
specified otherwise.
- while driving in Estonia, all passengers are expected to wear seat belts and
lights must be switched on at all times.
- Estonian laws against driving under the influence of alcohol are very strict
and follow a zero-tolerance policy.
