Did you know that Tartu will be in the spotlight in 2024 as the European Capital
of Culture? The year will be packed with events showcasing the historical and
cultural heritage of the second-biggest city in Estonia and the rest of South
Estonia. Now is the time to visit, as even

The general concept of the Tartu 2024 cultural program, *The Art of Survival*,
is more relevant than ever before. This idea centres around three aspects
related to the influence of art on the future of Europe - an environmentally
friendly culture with an emphasis on real human interactions, strong communities,
and survival skills. There is a varied program of over 300 events throughout the
year.

# Genialistid
Although not part of the official Tartu2024 programme, at least some
of us in the LOC spent our their university years to the tunes of songs like
