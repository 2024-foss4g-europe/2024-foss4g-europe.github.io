# Description
Workshops are the practical hands-on sessions to acquire new know-how in the
use of FOSS4G software. They should showcase current and emerging technologies,
and provide a direct interaction between our highly skilled OSGeo community
members and the public at large who want to learn something new or consolidate
their skills.

Workshop slots are 4 hours long and take place during two days prior to the
main conference days. We expect workshop participants to bring their own laptops.
Please indicate clearly if prior installation of any specific software is
required.

When submitting a workshop, please use the abstract to make the scope and
contents clear. Inclusion of a list of topics you want to cover is very welcome.
Ideally, you should also list the prerequisite skills e.g. basic skills in
Python programming are required.

You will also be asked to indicate the level of difficulty in the scale of
1 (beginner) to 3 (highly advanced) for the workshop.

Please, keep in mind this is a Free and Open Source Software conference.
Submissions promoting restricted license / closed source software will not
be accepted.

The FOSS4G Europe 2024 Local Organizing Committee understands the huge body of
work that goes into preparing a successful and educative workshop. Therefore
the accepted workshop presenters will be offered a possibility of a free
ticket to the conference main program.

# Selection process
We will have a two-week community vote on the submitted workshops.
The result of the community vote will be taken as a recommendation, but the
last decision lies with the volunteer [**Program Committee**](../program-committee/). The community vote is
essential for us for assigning rooms and capacity planning for participants to
get the best FOSS4G experience.
