Adopt-a-ticket is your chance to support FOSS4GE 2024 by purchasing any number of
extra tickets for the conference that will be donated to our wonderful workshop
instructors and Travel Grant Program (TGP) receivers.

## Why?
- We are dedicated to running the
[**Travel Grant Program**](../../registration/travel-grant/) (TGP) - a way to
facilitate accessibility and diversity in the event. In addition to a
monetary grant for grantees' travel and accommodation expenses handled in
cooperation with OSGeo, the LOC will grant free access to the conference main
days plus one workshop of choice for all Travel Grant receivers.
- the LOC understands that preparing and conducting an educative and
successful workshop takes quite some effort and time. This is the reason we are
giving away free tickets to all workshop instructors.

We do this because we believe this is the right thing to do.

But this also means that the conference will miss out on some of the income funds
although we still need to cover the related expenses (lunches, coffee breaks, etc).
This is where we would appreciate your help. Instead of increasing the ticket
cost for all we chose to allow you to make a conscious choice.

## How does this work?
When registering for the conference, you can choose between any of the add-ons: a
t-shirt, a mug, workshop tickets and so on. One of the add-ons there is
called _Adopt-a-ticket_, your chance to help us raise extra funds to do the
right thing.

We see it equally as an opportunity for smaller organizations and individuals
who would like to support the conference but for whom the existing
[**sponsorship levels**](../../call-for-sponsors/) are too expensive.

## What's in it for you?
With _Adopt-a-ticket_ you can purchase any number of extra tickets. In return
we would like to show our gratitude by having you included in the
[**Honorable mentions**](../../sponsors/honorable-mentions/) section of the
conference homepage. If you buy more than one extra ticket with _adopt-a-ticket_
then you would instead be eligible for any of the predefined
[**sponsor packages**](../../call-for-sponsors/) in an equal amount.
