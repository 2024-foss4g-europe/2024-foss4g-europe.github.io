## Other events

### Business to Business (B2B)
**Tuesday, 2 July 2024**

B2B offers a possibility to network and connect with businesses and participants
on the spot. In addition, the sponsors get a chance to present themselves.
Appetizers, snacks and beverages will be provided at the event. All this happens
right before the main conference starts so that you have lots more opportunities
to strengthen your network!


### Geochicas Take Tartu
**Tuesday, 2 July 2024**


### Ice-Breaker
**Wednesday, 3 July, 2024**

Food and drinks will be offered to all registered participants in _Aparaaditehas_
(“Widget Factory”). Situated in a former factory complex which used to house
manufacturies for producing parts for Soviet submarines, zippers, and
non-functional umbrellas, it has now been converted into a space for
cafes, restaurants, events, exhibitions, workshops, and performances.

### Social Bytes
**Thursday, 4 July 2024**

For the main party on Thursday evening we will head to _Lodjakoda_ (“Barge hall”)
for a glimpse of Estonian culture, some food, and beverages. Lodjakoda is a
traditional wooden ship building yard where

    title="a new two mast river barge is currently built"

>}}**. By all calculations it will be launched in the end of
April 2024. So if everything goes by plan we should be able to fit in the hall
comfortably.
