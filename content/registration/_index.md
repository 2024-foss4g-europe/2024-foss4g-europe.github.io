### The ticket shop is closed (as of 21 June)

**All conference tickets are sold out and it is not possible to purchase them on-site!**

This has been a fantastic rollercoaster ride with a way higher community
interest than we were ever expecting based on previous FOSS4GE conferences.

If you were not able to secure your ticket then we will have live streams of all
parallel sessions, and recordings made available afterwards.

If you're a lucky ticket holder, then see you in Tartu very soon!
