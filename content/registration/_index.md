## Other events
### Business to Business (B2B)
**Tuesday, 2 July 2024**

B2B offers a possibility to network and connect with businesses and participants
on the spot. In addition, the sponsors get a chance to present themselves.
Appetizers, snacks and beverages will be provided at the event. All this happens
right before the main conference starts so that you have lots more opportunities
to strengthen your network!


### GeoChicas Take Tartu
**Tuesday, 2 July 2024**

GeoChicas are an international women’s mapping community with members in more
than 12 different countries. Our aim is for women to have a greater presence and
participation in key OSM events, increase female participation and leadership,
and work on mapping projects which benefit women. Our main focus as a group is
to help close the gender gap in the OSM community across participation, data
creation and curation.

Everyone is welcome to join the GeoChicas Take Tartu event on 2 July after the
B2B meeting in a closeby venue called
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www.facebook.com/kultuuriklubiSalong/"
    title="Salong"
    target="blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**, a culture club known as the place of mainstream, side-stream, direct and
alternating current parties, concerts, movie evenings, quizes, exhibitions, and
lectures for all, regardless of age or other peculiarities.

GeoChicas Take Tartu is an event where to meet other women and allies attending
FOSS4GE 2024 who are interested in closing the gender gap and working towards
diversity in our communities. First hour is only for women and people
identifying as women but afterwards everyone is welcome!

We’ll try to break the ice and get off to a great start at FOSS4G Europe 2024
while having fun and doing karaoke! First drink is on us!

### Ice-Breaker
**Wednesday, 3 July, 2024**

Food and drinks will be offered to all registered participants in _Aparaaditehas_
(“Widget Factory”). Situated in a former factory complex which used to house
manufacturies for producing parts for Soviet submarines, zippers, and
non-functional umbrellas, it has now been converted into a space for
cafes, restaurants, events, exhibitions, workshops, and performances.

### Social Bytes
**Thursday, 4 July 2024**

For the main party on Thursday evening we will head to _Lodjakoda_ (“Barge hall”)
for a glimpse of Estonian culture, some food, and beverages. Lodjakoda is a
traditional wooden ship building yard where
**{{<

    title="a new two mast river barge is currently built"
    target="blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**. By all calculations it will be launched in the end of
April 2024. So if everything goes by plan we should be able to fit in the hall
comfortably.
