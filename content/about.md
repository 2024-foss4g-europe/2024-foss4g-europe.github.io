## About FOSS4G Europe 2024
The Free and Open Source for Geospatial Europe (FOSS4GE) conference is the
European branch event of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) annual
conference.

OSGeo is the largest and most important international organization
that unites the community of developers, users, and advocates of free and
open source in geospatial.

The main focus of the organization is fostering the development, maintenance
and use of free and open source software for geospatial, open standards, and
open data. The democratizing nature of the field creates a basis for sharing
geographic data, promotes cooperation between organizations and individuals,
and enables the application of data in solving the most diverse everyday
problems, being the basis for such fields as map applications, logistics,
transport, infrastructure planning, organizing rescue work in
disaster areas, etc.

FOSS4G is a community event organized by volunteers, with a focus on
building a diverse and sustainable open community, sharing our own experiences
and learning from others. Although it is software that brings us together, it's
the deep care for the society and the environment that surrounds us, helping
solve the World's problems one bit at a time, that connects us.

The international conference series started in 2004 under the name FOSS/GRASS
User Conference and has been known as FOSS4G since 2006. The European regional
branch of the conference dates back to 2012 when the first FOSS4G Central and
Eastern Europe (FOSS4G-CEE) was held in Prague, Czechia. Set to take place when
the international conference is not in Europe, the European edition has since
then visited Bucharest, Romania (2013); Bremen, Germany (2014);
Como, Italy (2015); Paris, France(2017); Guimar√£es, Portugal (2018).

Bringing the conference series to Tartu, the start-up capital of Estonia, gives
the participants here the opportunity to present their work, make contacts and
share experiences among people dealing with similar problems on a global scale.
Bringing a recognized and important conference series to Estonia offers local
professionals and students access to high-quality educational material and the
opportunity to learn from internationally recognized experts.
