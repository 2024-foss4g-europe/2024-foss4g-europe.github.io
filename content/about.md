## About FOSS4G Europe 2024

The Free and Open Source for Geospatial Europe (FOSS4GE) conference is the
European branch event of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) annual
conference.

OSGeo is the largest and most important international professional association
that gathers developers and users of free and open source geoinformation software.
The main focus of the organization is geoinformatics, cartography and open
standards. The democratizing nature of the field creates a basis for sharing
geographic data, promotes cooperation between organizations and individuals,
and enables the application of data in solving the most diverse everyday
problems, being the basis for such fields as map applications, logistics,
transport, infrastructure planning, organizing rescue work in disaster areas, etc.

The international conference series started in 2004 under the name FOSS/GRASS
User Conference and has been known as FOSS4G since 2006. The conference
series will come to Estonia for the first time!

Bringing the conference series to Tartu, the start-up capital of Estonia, gives
the participants here the opportunity to present their work, make contacts and
share experiences among people dealing with similar problems on a global scale.
Bringing a recognized and important conference series to Estonia offers local
professionals and students access to high-quality educational material and the
opportunity to learn from internationally recognized experts.
