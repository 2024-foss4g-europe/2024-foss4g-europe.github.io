Tartu is situated in Southern Estonia. The capital city of Estonia, Tallinn is 180 km to the North-West. It lies about half way down the stream on the banks of river Emajõgi, one of the largest rivers of Estonia connecting the lakes Võrtsjärv and Peipsi. Tartu is an old historic region (historically also known as Tarbatu, or Dorpat) and was first mentioned by medieval chroniclers in 1030.

With a population of 100K it is the second largest city in Estonia, and home to multiple universities (including the University of Tartu established in 1632), and is often referred to as the “intellectual capital city” of Estonia.

Tartu is also home to the Ministry of Education and Research, the Estonian National Museum, the Supreme Court of Estonia, and theater Vanemuine - the oldest Estonian-language theaters in Estonia. Tartu is also the focal point of Estonia’s active technology sector as well as a hotbed of IT development and start-ups.

Everything in Tartu is within a 10-20 minute walking distance and therefore you do not need a car nor public transport to get around to most places. In addition, Tartu has a very efficient bike-share system which also gets to the suburbs of Tartu.

At every corner in Tartu, there are concert venues, exhibition halls, theaters, churches, museums and charming little cafés as well as various pubs and restaurants. An inseparable part of the city is its students who comprise around a quarter of the population and generate a lot of fun and energy.

In 2024, Tartu will be one of the European Capitals of Culture, so we expect a lot to be happening in the city in the weeks leading up to, during, and after FOSS4G Europe 2024.
